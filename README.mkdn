Useless LineageOS15.1 Rom for learning purposes 
===========



To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u git://github.com/gokur20/Useless_Lineageos15.1_Xiaomi_Mi_play_lotus -b lineage-15.1
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync -c


Note: -c is just to syncronize only 15.1 branch
```
Please see the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) for building instructions, by device.
